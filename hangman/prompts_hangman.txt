Hello! I am a huge fan of ChatGPT. Thanks for your help in making me more efficient and teaching me to be a better programmer.

Could you please help me by generating the code for the following web site? Could you please start by generating only the HMTL for this?

Please only generate the code that I need to add or change. You don't need to regenerate other existing code.

General Information:
1. I will copy the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data (if necessary) into seperate files.
2. The HTML will be in the main directory. The CSS will be in a subdirectory named "styles". The JavaScript will be in a subdirectory named "scripts". The data (if necessary) will be in a subdirectory named "data".
3. If necessary, there can be multiple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or data files.
4. At the start of each file please include the following as a comment in the code: "Assisted by ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI." 
5. Please include necessary comments in the code.
6. Additional detailed descriptions outside of the code are helpful, but not necessary.
7. The website should be responsive so that it can be used on both mobile and larger devices.
8. Please select colors that are subdued, but engaging.
9. Please use CSS variables for each of the colors.
10. Please select an appropriate font.
11. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.


Page Description:
1. The <title> should be "Hangman"
2. Please feel free to make improvements to description content: <meta name="description" content="">
3. <meta name="author" content="Jackson Heslop">
4. <meta property="og:title" content="Hangman">
5. <meta property="og:type" content="website">
6. <meta property="og:image" content="https://thekleiderschrank.com/fun/hangman/images/logo.jpg">
    <meta property="og:url" content="https://thekleiderschrank.com/fun/hangman/hangman_EN.html">
7. <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">
8. The page should have six sections: a header, the target word, the information window, guessed letter field, the hangman drawing, and a footer. The content should all be centered.
9. The header should be small and have the text "Hangman"
10. The target word should be the main focus of the page. 
11. The information window will have content that will change as described in the Process Description below. 
12. The information window will have a small info icon positioned on the right side. <span class="info-icon" id="info-icon">ℹ️</span> When the user clicks on this icon, then it will open an overlay that provides the rules of the game and can be closed by clicking on X in the top right corner. Please provide a suggestion for the game rules.
13. The initial content in the information window should be: "Welcome to Hangman!<br>Player 1, please guess your first letter."
14. The guessed letter field should have a header and be empty initially. Over the course of the game, letters that have been incorrectly guessed will be shown in this area.
15. The hangman drawing should have a header and be empty initially. For each incorrectly guessed letter it will draw the next hangman shape.
16. It should be possible to see the the target word, the information window, guessed letter field, and the hangman drawing at the same time. 
17. The footer has a link to thekleiderschrank.com. It also has a small image (images/german.png) in the centered on the right. The "alt" is "Flag to change languages". This image is an <a>. The href is "hangman_DE.html". The aspect ratio of the image should be maintained. The background color of the footer should be #807475 and the font color should be #fbfbeb.


Process Description:
1. The game starts by only displaying the header, a temporary start form, and footer. The temporary start form asks the game leader to enter the number of players and to enter the target word or phrase. There is a button to "Start Playing".
2. When the game leader clicks the start playing button, and the the program checks to see if the number of players have been entered and if the target has been entered. If not, then the information in the form should be maintained and it should provide a message to complete the missing information.
3. If the information is correct, the start form is no longer displayed. The target word, the information window, guessed letter field, and the hangman drawing are displayed. The target is displayed with underscores replacing each of the letters. Spaces will be displayed as spaces.
4. The information window instructs Player X to enter a letter with a button to confirm the letter. It should be limited so that the player can only enter one character. There is also a button to solve the puzzle.
5. If the player enters a letter and clicks the button to confirm the letter. The program will check to see if the letter has already been entered. If it has already been entered, then it will display a message that the letter has already been entered and that the player should try again.
6. If the letter has not been entered, then the program will check to see if the letter is in the target. If the letter is in the target then the underscores will be changed to the letter for all of the occurances in the target. The information window will display: Congratulations! The letter "X" is used "X" times. There is then a button for the next player to start their turn.
7. If the letter is not in the target, then the letter will be added to the guessed letter field. The next shape will be drawn in the hangman drawing. The information window will display: Sorry, the letter "X" is not used. There is then a button for the next player to start their turn.
8. This process repeats itself until one of the following occur: 
8.1 The players guess all of the letters in the target. If this occurs, then after the last player guesses the last letter the information window will display: Congratulations Player "X"! You have solved the puzzle. Then there is a button to play again.
8.2 A player clicks on the button to solve the puzzle. The information window displays the message: Player X, please enter your guess. There is a form where they can enter their guess for the word or phrase. There is a button to confirm their guess. When the player presses this button, the program checks to see if the guess is identical to the target. If it is identical then the information window will display: Congratulations Player "X"! You have solved the puzzle. Then there is a button to restart the game. If the guess is not identical to the target, then the information window will display: Sorry Player X, "THE PLAYER'S GUESS" is not correct. You will miss your next turn. There should be a button for the next player. The player that made the incorrect guess should then be skipped for their next turn, but should be able to play again in the turn after that.
8.3 The drawing for the hangman drawing is completed. The information window displays: Sorry, but you have lost! The correct solution was "TARGET". A button to play again is also displayed.
9. When the player presses the button to restart the game, it clears all information regarding the number of players, the target, and the guessed letters (and any other relevant information) and the page starts again at the beginning.
